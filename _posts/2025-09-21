I've spun up and shut down various blogs across wordpress, self-hosted and Substack over the last decade.
Using this space to write about any topic and expect it to persist.

My plans are to share things I am personally interested in, such as diving deep into topics like the incentive design on Aerodrome, trade-offs within context building for LLMs, Marcel Duchamp, Theological history, game theory, Kelly criterion, AMM vs CLOB vs CFMM design, etc.

I do not expect any fanfare from this but rather hope the practice and publishing of these topics helps improve my standing on these topics, and more.
